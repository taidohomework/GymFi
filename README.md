**Project Description:** 
GymFi is an innovative platform that transforms fitness achievements into a digital currency called GymFi coins. By integrating with health tracking apps, GymFi leverages blockchain technology to ensure data transparency, security, and corruption resistance. Users can earn GymFi coins based on their fat burn percentage, which can then be exchanged for NFTs or SOL coins, promoting a healthy lifestyle and providing tangible rewards.
